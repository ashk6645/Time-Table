# Time-Table

A lightweight, browser-based timetable app built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs entirely on the client (no backend), so you can open it locally or host it with GitHub Pages.

- Live demo: https://ashk6645.github.io/Time-Table/
- Repository: https://github.com/ashk6645/Time-Table

> Note: This project’s UI and interactivity are implemented in a single-page setup:
> - [index.html](index.html) — markup and app shell
> - [styles.css](styles.css) — styles and layout
> - [script.js](script.js) — application logic and interactions

---

## Highlights

- Simple single-page app — no build tools or dependencies required.
- Fully client-side — just open `index.html` in a browser.
- Easy to customize — tweak colors, spacing, and typography in `styles.css`.

## Getting Started

### 1) Run locally

- Option A (quickest): Download the repo as a ZIP, unzip it, and double-click `index.html`.
- Option B (clone):
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ashk6645/Time-Table.git
  cd Time-Table
  # then open index.html in your browser
  ```
- Optional: Use a local web server (recommended during development)  
  For example, with VS Code’s Live Server extension or:
  ```bash
  # Python 3
  python -m http.server 8080
  # then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
  ```

### 2) Use the app

Open the page and interact with the timetable UI directly in your browser. Because everything is client-side, your data and changes (if persisted) stay in your browser environment.

## Project Structure

```
Time-Table/
├─ index.html    # App markup and root container
├─ styles.css    # Styling and layout
└─ script.js     # Interactive behavior and core logic
```

- index.html  
  Provides the base structure and hooks for the timetable UI.

- styles.css  
  Defines the layout, color palette, and typography. Adjust variables, colors, and spacing here to brand the timetable to your needs.

- script.js  
  Implements the interactive logic (event handlers, rendering, and behaviors). If you’re extending functionality, this is where you’ll add new features.

---

## Customization

- Styling: Edit [styles.css](styles.css) to change fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive behavior.
- Markup: Update [index.html](index.html) to add or rearrange UI sections.
- Behavior: Extend [script.js](script.js) to add new interactions or modify existing ones.

Tip: Commit small, incremental changes and test in your browser as you go.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Dark mode and theme switcher
- Export or print-friendly layout
- Data persistence (e.g., localStorage) or import/export
- Accessibility refinements (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles)

If any of these already exist in your local version, feel free to document them under “Highlights” and remove them from the roadmap.
